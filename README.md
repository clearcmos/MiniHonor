That's it. No bells, no whistles.

- **Draggable** - Position anywhere on screen, saved between sessions

## Why This Addon?

Sometimes you just want to know your honor without opening panels or installing a full tracking suite.

MiniHonor is intentionally simple - a quick-glance widget like a clock display. If you need rank tracking, weekly milestones, or honor-per-hour stats, check out addons like Ranker instead.

## Usage

- Drag the frame to reposition
- Left-click to open PVP panel
- `/MiniHonor` to print honor to chat
